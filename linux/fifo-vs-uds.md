Both FIFO (named pipes) and UNIX domain sockets are mechanisms for inter-process communication (IPC) on Unix-like systems. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Complexity and Use Case**:
   - **FIFO (Named Pipes)**:
     - FIFOs are simpler to set up and use for one-way or unidirectional communication. If you just need a straightforward way for one process to send data to another, a FIFO might be sufficient.
   - **UNIX Domain Sockets**:
     - UNIX domain sockets are more versatile than FIFOs. They support bidirectional communication, so if you need a more interactive communication where both processes send and receive data, UNIX domain sockets are a better choice.

2. **Performance**:
   - UNIX domain sockets can offer better performance than FIFOs, especially for bidirectional communication. This is because, with FIFOs, you'd typically need two separate pipes for bidirectional communication, which can introduce additional overhead.

3. **Connection Semantics**:
   - UNIX domain sockets, like TCP/IP sockets, have connection semantics. This means you can accept or reject connections, which can be useful if you want more control over who can connect to your service. With FIFOs, any process that has the appropriate permissions can read from or write to the pipe.

4. **Filesystem Presence**:
   - Both FIFOs and UNIX domain sockets exist as entries in the filesystem, but there's a subtle difference:
     - FIFOs remain in the filesystem until they're explicitly deleted.
     - UNIX domain socket files are automatically removed when the socket is closed, but sometimes they might not be, especially if the process crashes. In such cases, you'd need to handle the cleanup.

5. **Data Transfer Semantics**:
   - **FIFO**:
     - Data written to a FIFO can be read once and only once. Once data is read from the pipe, it's removed.
   - **UNIX Domain Sockets**:
     - They allow for a more interactive and stateful communication. Data can be sent back and forth, and the processes can maintain a conversation-like state.

6. **Compatibility**:
   - If you're designing software that might be ported to non-Unix-like systems, consider that UNIX domain sockets are specific to Unix-like systems. FIFOs, while most commonly associated with Unix, might have equivalents or similar concepts on other platforms.

7. **Security**:
   - UNIX domain sockets can use the file system's permission model, but they also support passing file descriptors and process credentials (UID, GID) between processes. This can be useful for certain types of IPC where you need to verify the identity of the connecting process.

In summary, if you need simple, one-way communication and don't want to deal with the complexities of connection setup and teardown, FIFOs might be the way to go. On the other hand, if you need bidirectional communication, better performance, or more control over connections, UNIX domain sockets are a better choice.
