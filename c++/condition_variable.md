### C++ Condition Variable Example

Suppose you are developing a multi-threaded application where one thread is responsible for producing data, and another thread is responsible for consuming that data. You want to ensure that the consumer thread waits until there is data to consume. This is a classic producer-consumer problem, and `std::condition_variable` can be used to synchronize the two threads.

#### Code Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>
#include <queue>

std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
std::queue<int> data_queue;
bool done = false;

void producer() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        data_queue.push(i);
        std::cout << "Produced: " << i << '\n';
        cv.notify_one(); // Notify the consumer that data is ready
    }
    done = true; // Signal that production is done
    cv.notify_one(); // Notify the consumer one last time
}

void consumer() {
    while (!done || !data_queue.empty()) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        cv.wait(lock, [] { return !data_queue.empty() || done; });
        while (!data_queue.empty()) {
            int value = data_queue.front();
            data_queue.pop();
            std::cout << "Consumed: " << value << '\n';
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread producer_thread(producer);
    std::thread consumer_thread(consumer);
    producer_thread.join();
    consumer_thread.join();
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Mutex (`std::mutex`):** This is used to synchronize access to shared data (`data_queue` and `done`).

2. **Condition Variable (`std::condition_variable`):** This allows threads to wait for some condition to be satisfied.

3. **Producer Function:** This function simulates producing data. It locks the mutex, pushes data into the queue, and then notifies the consumer that data is ready.

4. **Consumer Function:** This function simulates consuming data. It waits for the condition variable until there is data in the queue or production is done. If there's data, it consumes it.

5. **Main Function:** This function starts the producer and consumer threads and waits for them to complete.

In this example, the producer and consumer work in tandem, with the producer notifying the consumer whenever there's new data to consume. The consumer waits for this notification and then processes the data. This ensures that the consumer doesn't try to consume data that hasn't been produced yet, and it illustrates a real-world scenario where `std::condition_variable` can be very useful.

Calling `.notify_one()` on a `std::condition_variable` will unblock one of the waiting threads, causing it to reacquire the lock and then invoke the predicate to check if the condition has been met.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens:

1. **Thread Calls `wait`:** The waiting thread calls `wait`, passing in the lock and the predicate. The lock is released, and the thread begins waiting.

2. **Another Thread Calls `notify_one`:** A different thread (e.g., the producer in our example) modifies the shared data in such a way that the condition might be satisfied. It then calls `notify_one` to wake up one of the waiting threads.

3. **Waiting Thread Wakes Up:** The waiting thread is awakened by the notification. It reacquires the lock and then invokes the predicate to check if the condition has been met.

4. **Predicate Returns `true` or `false`:** If the predicate returns `true`, the `wait` method returns, and the thread continues execution. If the predicate returns `false`, the thread releases the lock and goes back to waiting. This ensures that the thread continues to wait if it was awakened by a spurious wakeup or if the condition was not actually satisfied.

In our example, the predicate checks whether the data queue is not empty or the production is done. If the producer thread adds data to the queue and then calls `notify_one`, the consumer thread will wake up, check the predicate, and if the queue is not empty, continue to consume the data.

This mechanism ensures that the waiting thread responds to changes in the shared data and that it only proceeds if the condition is actually satisfied. It provides a robust and efficient way to synchronize threads based on specific conditions.
