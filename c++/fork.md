The relationship between the parent and child process created by `fork` is more nuanced than simply being completely independent copies.

Here's a more detailed look at what happens when `fork` is called:

### Memory Space

- **Virtual Memory**: Both the parent and child processes have their own separate virtual memory spaces. This means that variables and data structures are not shared between the parent and child; changes in one process do not affect the other.

- **Copy-on-Write (COW)**: Modern operating systems often use a technique called copy-on-write to optimize the forking process. When `fork` is called, the operating system does not immediately create a complete copy of the parent's memory for the child. Instead, it allows both processes to share the same physical memory pages, marking them as read-only. If either process tries to modify a shared page, the operating system makes a copy of that page for the modifying process. This allows the child to share as much memory as possible with the parent, only duplicating what needs to be changed.

### File Descriptors

- **Shared File Descriptors**: File descriptors, including those for pipes, are shared between the parent and child in the sense that they refer to the same underlying objects (e.g., files, pipes, sockets). This is what allows the parent and child to communicate through a pipe; they both have file descriptors that refer to the same pipe.

- **Independent File Descriptor Tables**: While the file descriptors themselves refer to the same objects, the parent and child have independent file descriptor tables. This means that if the parent closes a file descriptor, it does not close that file descriptor in the child, and vice versa.

### Conclusion

The relationship between the parent and child process created by `fork` is complex. While they have separate virtual memory spaces and independent file descriptor tables, they can share physical memory through copy-on-write, and their file descriptors can refer to the same underlying objects.

This combination of separation and sharing enables powerful patterns of inter-process communication and parallel processing while maintaining the independence and isolation of individual processes. It's a fundamental feature of Unix-like operating systems and is used in a wide variety of applications and system tools.
